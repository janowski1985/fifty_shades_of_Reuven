Learning Python by coding 50 exercises from "python workout: 50 ten-minute exercises" book by Reuven Lerner 

A bit of a history. I never seen myself as a programer, so I did not bother to learn programming language. After taking course "Python Fundamentals" created by Reuven Lerner I have changed my mind and open for programming experience. I also finished his free course "Python for non-programmers" (https://store.lerner.co.il/view/courses/python-for-non-programmers-live), which gives almost the same content as "Python Fundamentals", but is free and equally amazing! I am still very bad in programming (or shell I say my knowledge is very basic at this stage ;) ), but I started to feel fun from lerning it. To advance a bit I decided to go through "python workout: 50 ten-minute exercises" book and post my execution of every excercise in my very first project on Github.

The project name requires a bit of explanation. Never watched Fifty Shades of Grey, but it is hard to not know what this movie is all about. A dose of masohism in a life. Well. programming is kind of a masochistic experience for me. I did not like it in the past, I did not want to lern it and yet I am here to post a code :).
